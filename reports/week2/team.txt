[a]The first section is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week — that is, your goals from a week ago. (The first week, it can be empty.)
[b]The second section should report the progress you've made this week: what you've done, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
[c]The third section should outline your plans and goals for the following week (including, in the team report, who is responsible). Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into your tasks for the next week. It's good to include some less-detailed longer-range schedule items in this list as well, so that you don't think just about the next week.
