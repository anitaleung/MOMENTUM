Updates this Week
=======================
(See checklist above for updates on goals from last week)

Other tasks completed this week:
- Helped with major revisions in project report
- Researched/learned Redux, React, Travis CI
- Added build bash script to repository

Feeling better about the direction of our project this week. I came to realize from the
staff's feedback that their main concerns are the basis of our problem -- and that doing
things such as user testing might be the best option to remedy many of these concerns.
Now that Haley is set on User Testing Manuscript to find pain points, we can focus 
much more on our implementation of back-end features, and focus on usability (the most
important aspect) last, once we have found out the best ways to perform these 
improvements.


Goals for Upcoming Week
=======================
[] Create re-made, finalized architecture
[] Implement EBS logic
[] Help create tests for EBS model
[] Implement client-side database using Redux
