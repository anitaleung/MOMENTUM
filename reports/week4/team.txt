Updates This Week
=======================

Updates on Goals
----------------
1: We refined the schedule by adding a couple more details and filling in week 6

2.a: We've completed a low fidelity mock-up of the GUI model 
2.b: We haven't yet hashed out a high-level dependency graph of our architecture plan, however we did decide on a general direction in how to improve the accuracy of Momentum

3.a: We're currently working on building the backend implementation model
3.b: We're building the bare-bones of the frontend portion. Our goal is to finish most of this by the end of this week
3.c: We've decided to use TypeScript unless problems arise down the road

4.a: Josh is currently working on the data graph for this week
4.b: Anita is assigned to work on other visualizations


Other Accomplishments
---------------------
- We've learned more about Manuscript, one of the existing competing tools through having to conduct user research on it 
- Josh initialized website with React and Typescript https://cse403-momentum.github.io/MOMENTUM/ 


Goals for Upcoming Week
=======================
1. [Haley and Leon] Finish conducting and analyzing user research
2. [Austin] Work on user manual
3. [Josh and Anita] Start implementing the front/backend of our web app 
4. [All] Refine mvp with additional enhancements based on user research
5. [All] Improve project goals based on client feedback
	5.a [All] Establish metrics for software success and evaluation plan so that we can reasonably complete this within the time frame of our course
	5.b [All] Refine our motivation and specify differences of what our tool vs existing tools accomplish
