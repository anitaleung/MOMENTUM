CSE 403: Week 4 Individual Report

4/10-4/16 Goals
========================
- Find more research papers, and read those, and papers we've already found,thoroughly.
- Investigate how to implement the uncertainty visualization strategies
described in IDL's recent papers. Possibly ask an author for code.
- Contribute to architecture and implementation overview.
- Try to find existing solutions for automating PROBE.
    - If none exist, think about why they don't exist.
    - Assess the difficulty of implementing such a tool.

Actual Progress
========================
I worked on architecture and implementation. In particular I proposed languages and frameworks to use for the project. We will likely use Typescript and ReactJS for the bulk of our project. I also realized that the uncertainty visualization code is publicly available in R, and I will need to decide whether to figure out how to call R code from TS or rewrite the viz in D3 and TS since I am more familiar with those tools.

I did less work on additional research than I would have liked, but I have a better sense of the space of existing solutions. In particular there is a simple equation that characterizes all time estimation tools.

I am becoming increasingly worried that coming up with a novel estimation implementation will be too difficult, and I don't think I will have enough time to brainstorm and research this to my satisfaction. I'm not sure if others have ideas about this.

I also set up a GitHub Pages site.

4/17-4/23 Goals
========================
- Ensure a minimal website is set up.
- Implement "When-ish is my bus?" visualization.
  - Ask if anyone else would like to work on this.
- Find *one* paper on automating time estimation.
- Establish a good system for pushing to the repo.
- Flesh out architecture and implementation plan.
