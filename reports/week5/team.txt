Concerns
- What are the staffâ€™s concerns about the project at this point?
  - Any concerns we have yet to address?
  - Any new concerns?
- Our concerns about the last set of feedback (on Project 4)
  - Comments received
    - Lack of justification on claims
      - We should have more evidence to justify our claims as we complete more user studies on Manuscript
    - Differences between Manuscript and our tool
      - Do both the tools display the same information but visualize them differently?
      - How is this beneficial?
    - Using Manuscript for our project
    - Why is ease of maintenance of the tool relevant as one of your two main goals?
    - Document is at too low a level of detail
    - Document should list all the features of your software and compare it to others
      - You need to give an overview first before diving into specifics
    - Concrete details about our evaluation
    - Task dependencies
- Clarifications
  - Expectations / Grading Rubric
  - Responsibility to other teams as their customers
